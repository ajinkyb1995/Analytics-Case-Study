# Analytics-Case-Study

Hello, my name is Ajinkya Bhavsar. I have recently applied to Vindiata Consulting Private Limited for the position of Data Analyst.

As part of the selection rounds, I was given a case study focused on an online gaming platform.

The case study involved analyzing an online gaming platform where multiple players engaged in gameplay throughout the month of October. As part of the gaming experience, some players made deposits into the platform, while others withdrew money.
The case study introduced a Loyalty Point formula to calculate loyalty points for players on an online gaming platform. The formula consists of several components:

Loyalty Point Calculation: The loyalty points are determined by combining different factors, including deposits, withdrawal amounts, the difference between deposits and withdrawals, and the number of games played.

Deposit Contribution: Loyalty points are influenced by 0.01 times the deposit amount made by players.

Withdrawal Contribution: Loyalty points are also influenced by 0.005 times the withdrawal amount made by players.

Difference Contribution: An additional factor is considered by calculating 0.001 times the maximum value between the difference of deposits and withdrawals or zero.

Games Played Contribution: Loyalty points are further influenced by 0.2 times the total number of games played by players.

Throughout the case study, several questions were posed to analyze and interpret the loyalty point formula.
